## Lab Works
### **Lab 1:** Markov Algorithms. [Solution](lab_1.pdf)
- Task 1: Create a Markov Normal Algorithm to reverse a word composed of the letters 'a' and 'b'.
- Task 2: Create a Markov Normal Algorithm to sort a word in the alphabet {a, b, c}.
### **Lab 2:** Tasks on Inductive Proofs in Peano Arithmetic. [Solution](lab_2.pdf)
- For each task, provide a full list of rules defining the operations and functions, as well as the protocol for unification of substitution symbols. If needed, introduce new lemmas, numbering them (L1, L2, etc.) for references in the unification protocol.
### **Lab 3:** Graph Algorithm Tasks. [Solution](lab_3.pdf)
#### Tasks: 
- Using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, find the weight matrix of the paths and the matrix of the first vertices' indices for these paths. Note that the graph is simple, so each edge is "passable" in both directions. For example, if it's given that 
$𝑤({𝑣_2,𝑣_5})=12$, both the path through vertices 2 and 5, as well as the reverse path through 5 and 2, are possible, and the weight of the edge in both directions is 12. Therefore, the weight matrix is symmetric.
- For the given pair of vertices $𝑣_b$ → $𝑣_𝑡$, extract the path from vertex $𝑣_𝑏$ to vertex $𝑣_𝑡$ from the path matrix as a sequence of vertex indices.
- Using Dijkstra's algorithm for the same pair of vertices, find the minimum weight and the corresponding path.
- Using Prim's algorithm, find the minimum spanning tree for the given graph as a list of the spanning tree's edges.
