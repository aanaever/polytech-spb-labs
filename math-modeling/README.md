Lab work report [Report](lab_2/lab_2_report.docx)
#### Task Overview:
To implement a random search method is to create a program in accordance with the algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. 
  • After writing a program that implements the method, you should test it on two test functions, the minimum of which is known in advance.
  • The test results should be presented in the form of tables and graphs reflecting the search trajectory.
  • Investigate the convergence and accuracy of the method for different steps and starting points of the search.
