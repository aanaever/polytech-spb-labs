This project involves the development of an application using the C++ programming language, along with the STL and wxWidgets libraries for creating the graphical user interface. The functionality of the application includes the ability to add, delete, mark tasks as completed, move tasks within the list, and clear the to-do list. It also allows tracking the progress of tasks through a progress bar and provides the option to edit tasks. The application also includes features to save the to-do list to a file and load it, ensuring data persistence between sessions. This application will serve as a useful tool for improving organization and boosting productivity in daily life. The development of this application holds significant practical and educational value.
